# High Availability Web Application Deployment & Versioning on Kubernetes

This project demonstrates the development, containerization, and deployment of a Node.js web application on a Kubernetes cluster with high availability.

## Project Overview

- Developed and deployed a **Node.js web application** on a Kubernetes cluster.  
- Created a **Docker image** for the application and deployed it using a **Deployment** with multiple replicas to ensure **fault tolerance**.  
- Implemented a **Service** to expose the application externally and manage traffic to the Pods.  
- Updated the application to a **new version**, pushed the updated image to **Docker Hub**, and redeployed it successfully on Kubernetes, demonstrating seamless **rolling updates**.  
- Leveraged **labels, selectors, and container orchestration best practices** to ensure maintainable and scalable deployment.  
- Gained hands-on experience with **Pods, Deployments, Services, and container versioning** in a production-like Kubernetes environment.  

## Outcome

- Achieved a **scalable, fault-tolerant web application deployment**.  
- Updates to the application are reflected **in real-time across the cluster**.  
- Highlights practical **DevOps and Kubernetes proficiency**.

## Features

- **High Availability:** Multiple replicas of the application running across nodes.  
- **Rolling Updates:** Smooth version updates with zero downtime.  
- **External Access:** Service exposes the application outside the cluster.  
- **Scalability:** Easily scale the number of replicas using Deployment.  
- **Containerization:** Dockerized application with versioning on Docker Hub.
